## SCORING INSTRUCTIONS
1. Carefully review the candidate's profile (education, experience, salary, skills)
2. If a job is provided, consider the industry and role for salary benchmarking and shortage occupation matching
3. Apply the scoring rules exactly as defined above
4. Calculate the total raw score (sum of all 6 criteria)
5. Convert to percentage: (raw_score / 110) * 100, rounded to nearest integer
6. Determine verdict based on raw score thresholds
7. Provide clear, concise notes explaining each criterion's score
8. If data is missing for a criterion, apply conservative baseline scores as indicated
9. Do NOT hallucinate data - if information is not provided, state that clearly in notes

## IMPORTANT
- Be strict and objective - do not inflate scores
- Missing data should result in conservative baseline scores
- Notes must be specific and reference actual data from the profile
- The total score must be mathematically correct
